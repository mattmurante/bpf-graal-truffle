/**
 * This class defines operations that can be performed on SL Objects. While we could define all
 * these operations as individual AST nodes, We opted to define those operations by using
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.library.Library a Truffle library}, or more concretely the
 * {@link InteropLibrary}. This has several advantages, but the primary one is that it allows SL
 * objects to be used in the interoperability message protocol, i.e. It allows other languages and
 * tools to operate on SL objects without necessarily knowing they are SL objects.
 * 
 * SL Objects are essentially instances of {@link DynamicObject} (objects whose members can be
 * dynamically added and removed). Our {@link SLObjectType} class thus extends {@link ObjectType} an
 * extensible object type descriptor for {@link DynamicObject}s. We also annotate the class with
 * {@link ExportLibrary} with value {@link InteropLibrary InteropLibrary.class} and receiverType
 * {@link DynamicObject DynamicObject.class}. This essentially ensures that the build system and
 * runtime know that this class specifies the interop messages (i.e. operations) that SL can do on
 * {@link DynamicObject} instances.
